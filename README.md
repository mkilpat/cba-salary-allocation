# cba-salary-allocation
Repository for CBA salary allocation dataset and data exploration

## Directions
To produce all the results and figures from the paper and presentation, execute the run.R script. This includes 
everything from the CBA_dataset notebook and MLB Salary Notebook that ended up being relavent for the final paper.

The CBA Dataset Notebook includes additional notes on where different data was sourced exactly, while the MLB Salary Notebook was an initial exploration of the Lahman Salaries table.
